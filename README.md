The client side of this application is created with Angular 6, the server side is a ASP.NET CORE 2.2 web api application. At the back end is a .NET Standard library project and a Sqlite database that's pre-seeded with a small set of data. 

The Angular site is configured to output to wwwroot folder when building with ng cli, so that both Angular web page and the api can be served from the same port.

To run it after downloading, simply open the solution in Visual Studio, (I used VS 2019, I think 2017 should work as well), and hit Ctr + F5.
